1 Abbrevs mode
--------------

- `https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AbbrevMode <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AbbrevMode>`_

- ``abbrev-mode`` start the (minor) mode

- ``C-x a l`` (``add-mode-abbrev``) Define abbrev for current mode.

- ``C-x a i l`` (``inverse-add-mode-abbrev``) define a word in the buffer as a mode-specific abbrev

- ``list-abbrevs`` Display a list of defined abbrevs

- ``edit-abbrevs`` edit abbrevs. This is the best way to add or remove abbrevs. The number in the middle column is the number of times you've used (expanded) the abbrev. To remove a abbrev, just delete the line. To add a abbrev, just add a line. When done, to load and or save, call any of:

  - ``C-c C-c`` (``edit-abbrevs-redefine``) Redefine abbrevs according to current buffer contents.

  - ``C-x C-s`` (``abbrev-edit-save-buffer``) Redefine and save to abbrev file.

1.1 options
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``abbrev-file-name`` The abbrevs is saved in a file at a path specified by this variable (default: ``\~/.emacs.d/abbrev_defs``)

- ``save-abbrevs``

2 ``(ansi-)term`` mode
----------------------

- ``C-c C-j`` (``term-line-mode``) switch to line mode (acts like an editor).

- ``C-c C-k`` (``term-char-mode``) switch to char mode (acts like a usual terminal).

- ``C-c C-c`` (``term-interrupt-subjob``) send a literal ``C-c`` to the sub-shell

- ``C-c <char>`` is equivalent to ``C-x <char>`` in normal Emacs modes, e.g. ``C-c o`` invokes the global binding of ``C-x o`` which is normally \`~other-window~'

- ``C-c C-q`` (``term-pager-toggle``) toggle the page-at-a-time feature. When enabled, the mode-line displays the word \`~page~' and each time Term receives more than a screenful of output, it pauses and displays \`~\*\*MORE\*\*~' in the mode-line where ``<SPC>`` displays the next screenful of output and ``?`` displays the other options -- the interface is similar to the ``more`` program.

- When the bash complains “cannot read termcap database”, then create a symlink ``~/.terminfo/65 -> /usr/local/share/emacs/26.3/etc/e`` that is another symlink to ``/usr/local/Cellar/emacs-mac/emacs-26.3-z-mac-7.7/share/emacs/26.3/etc/``. Sources say that the name of directory should be ``e`` but in this macos it has to be ``65``. Check this by ``ls /usr/share/terminfo`` and then ``sudo find /usr/share/terminfo -name "eterm*"``.

3 Bookmarks
-----------

- ``C-x r m`` (``bookmark-set``) Set the bookmark for the visited file, at point

- ``C-x r l`` (``list-bookmarks``) list all bookmarks

- ``C-x r b`` (``bookmark-jump``) then type a bookmark name. You can type ``\*`` for wildcard

- ``bookmark-save`` save all the current bookmark values in the default bookmark file ``\~/.emacs.d/bookmarks``. Can be modified by setting the variable ``bookmark-default-file``

- when in the bookmark file:

  - ``d`` mark the current item for remove

  - ``x`` remove all marked ones

  - ``r`` rename current item's title

  - ``s`` save the change

4 helm
------

- ``RET`` executes the default action upon exiting the Helm session

- ``C-j`` executes the default action but without exiting the Helm session

- ``TAB`` displays a list of actions available

- ``C-@`` mark/unmark a candidate

- ``M-U`` unmark all visible marked candidates at once

5 ``\*buffers*``
----------------

- ``C-x C-b`` helm-buffers

- ``M-SPC`` or ``C-SPC`` mark

- ``C-x >`` and ``C-x <`` horizontal scroll

- ``C-x C-s``  save buffer without leaving Helm

- ``C-x s`` save all unsaved buffers

- ``C-c d`` delete buffer without leaving Helm

- ``M-D`` delete marked buffers and leave Helm

- ``C-x k`` is meant to kill buffers but cannot kill multiple buffers selected by ``C-SPC`` with ``RET``.

6 ``\*kill-buffer*``
--------------------

- This seems only useful when killing the currently opened buffer

- ``C-x k`` open kill-buffer

7 Case conversion A <-> a
-------------------------

- ``M-l/M-u`` (``downcase-word/upcase-word``) convert following word to lower/upper case.

- ``M-c`` (``capitalize-word``) capitalize the following word.

- ``C-x C-l/C-x C-u`` (``downcase-region/upcase-region``) convert region to lower/upper case

8 Deleting and killing
----------------------

8.1 Deleting by character
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``<Del>~/~C-d`` Delete the character before/after point

- ``M-d~/~M-<Del>`` Kill forward/back to the end/beginning of the next/previous word

- ``C-k~/~M-k`` Kill to the end of the line/sentence

- ``C-o`` Insert a blank line after the cursor

- ``C-S-<DEL>`` (``kill-whole-line``) Kill a whole line

- ``C-u 50`` or ``M-5 0 <moving_command>`` repeat the moving command by 50 times. The tutorial says ``C-u`` is better \`because it works on any terminal'. \`50' is called a "prefix argument". Exception: ``C-u 8 C-v~/~C-u 8 M-v`` Instead of scrolling 8 pages up/down, it scrolls the current screen by 8 lines up/down.

- ``mouse-3`` (right click) set the mark at point then select up to and move point to where you click

- ``'shifted cursor motion keys'`` Set the mark at point if the mark is inactive, then move point.

- ``C-w`` Kill the selected region

- ``C-x <TAB>`` Indent the selected region

- ``M-$`` Check the spelling of words

- ``C-/``, ``C-_``, ``C-x u`` **undo**. On some text terminals, typing ``C-/`` actually sends ``C-_`` to Emacs.

- ``C-g`` changes the \`direction'. So, after undoing ``C-/`` n-times, doing ``C-g C-/`` and repeating ``C-/`` (n-1)-times will do **redo** all.

- the auto saved file's name for "``hello.c``" is "``#hello.c#``". To recover auto-saved editing, run ``M-x recover-this-file <RET>``

9 Dired
-------

- ``C-x d`` invoke Dired, ``C-x 5 d`` (``dired-other-frame``)

- ``g`` re-read all directories (retains all marks)

- ``C-x C-q`` (``dired-toggle-read-only``) edit Dired buffer with Wdired, or make it read-only. After the edit, ``C-c C-c`` to apply the changes, or ``C-c <ESC>`` (or ``C-c C-k``) to cancel.

  - We can even edit symlinks by editing the dired buffer: a symlink is displayed as ``<SYMLINK> -> <TARGET>`` and we can edit ``TARGET``. Short listing mode only shows ``<SYMLINK> ->`` without target but we can switch to the long listing with ``(``.

- Saving text

  - ``C-x r s r`` (``copy-to-register``) copy region into register ``r``

  - ``C-x r i r`` (``insert-register``) insert text from register ``r``

  - ``M-x append-to-register RET r`` append region to text in register ``r``

24 Select
---------

- ``C-x h`` (``mark-whoe-buffer``) put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer (select all)

25 Sessions
-----------

- See info > (emacs)Top > Saving Emacs Sessions for detail

- if the variable ``desktop-save-mode`` is ``t``,

  - Emacs looks, when it started, for a saved desktop in the current directory or in the location specified by ``desktop-path`` if specified by command ``desktop-change-dir``

  - Emacs, by default, auto-saves the desktop whenever any of it changes. ``desktop-auto-save-timeout`` determines how frequently Emacs checks for modifications

- ``M-x desktop-save`` Manually save the desktop

- ``M-x desktop-clear`` empty the Emacs desktop by killing all buffers and clears the global variables listed in ``desktop-clear-preserve-buffers-regexp``

- if Emacs crashes, the lock stays on the dektop file and Emacs will ask next time whether use the locked desktop file or not. the variable ``desktop-load-locked-desktop`` valued ``nil`` will load the locked desktop file without asking

26 Symbol
---------

- ``C-q C-<KEY>`` Enter ``^<KEY>`` symbol, eg. ``^A`` for ``CTRL-A`` key combination

27 Timestamp
------------

- ``C-u M-! date`` insert timestamp manually.

- Placing the line ``Time-stamp: " "`` or ``Time-stamp: "< >"`` within the first eight lines will make Emacs automatically put date and time on that line. The keyword ``Time-stamp`` can be customizing variables ``time-stamp-start``, ``time-stamp-end`` as the following, as an example.

  ::

      # -*- time-stamp-start: "DATE:\\s-"; time-stamp-end: "$"; time-stamp-format: "%:b %02d, %:y" -*-
      #+DATE: 

  This will automatically update the timestamp on ``DATE`` whenever saving any change. The function ``time-stamp-toggle-active`` will switch time-stamping on/off, the option ``time-stamp-active`` will set the mode on/off.

29 YASnippet
------------

- ``C-c C-n`` (``yas-new-snippet``) Creates a new buffer with a template for making a new snippet. The buffer is in snippet-mode (see below). When you are done editing the new snippet, use ``C-c C-c`` to save it.

29.1 variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
