#+TITLE: My Org mode Note

* Font
 - ~*bold*~, ~/italic/~, ~_underlined_~, ~=verbatim=~, ~~code~~, ~+strike-through+~, ~/~italic code~/~

* Visibility cycling
 - ~<TAB>~ (~org-cycle~) Subtree cycling

* Insert entries
- ~M-<RET>~ (~org-meta-return~) Insert a new heading, item or row.
- ~C-<RET>~ (~org-insert-heading-respect-content~) Insert a new heading at the end of the current subtree.
- ~<TAB>~ (~org-cycle~) The first ~<TAB>~ demotes the entry to become a child of the previous one.  The next ~<TAB>~ makes it a parent, and so on, all the way to top level.  Yet another ~<TAB>~, and you are back to the initial level.

* Promoting/Demoting headings
- ~M-<LEFT>~ (~org-do-promote~) Promote current heading by one level.
- ~M-<RIGHT>~ (~org-do-demote~) Demote current heading by one level.
- ~M-S-<LEFT>~ (~org-promote-subtree~) Promote the current subtree by one level.
- ~M-S-<RIGHT>~ (~org-demote-subtree~) Demote the current subtree by one level.

* Moving subtrees up/down
- ~M-<UP>~ (~org-move-subtree-up~) Move subtree up.
- ~M-<DOWN>~ (~org-move-subtree-down~) Move subtree down.

* Exporting
** HTML export command
- ~C-c C-e h h~ (~org-html-export-to-html~) Export as HTML file with a ‘.html’ extension.

* time stamp
- ~C-c .~ (~org-time-stamp~) Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp. When the cursor is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is used to modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one. When this command is used twice in succession, a time range is inserted.
- ~C-c !~ (~org-time-stamp-inactive~) Like ~C-c .~, but insert an inactive timestamp that will not cause an agenda entry.
- ~C-u C-c .~ / ~C-u C-c !~ Like ~C-c .~ and ~C-c !~, but use the alternative format which contains date and time. The default time can be rounded to multiples of 5 minutes, see the option ~org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes~.

** variables

- ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~

* Footnote
 - ~[fn:1]~ footnote definition when at column 0
 - ~C-c C-x f~ switch footnote definition / (first) reference or create a new footnote
 - ~C-c C-c~ Jump between definition and reference.

* Superscript and subscript
 - ~^~ and ~_~ are used to indicate super- and subscripts. We may surround multi-character sub- and superscripts with curly braces.
 - ~org-use-sub-superscripts~ a variable that determines whether to interprete ~_~ as a subscript or not. Eg. setting this variable to ~{}~, '~a_b~' is not interpreted as a subscript, but '~a_{b}~ is.
 - ~C-c C-x \~ (~org-toggle-pretty-entities~) formats sub- and superscripts in a WYSIWYM way.

* Special symbols
 - ~\~ and maybe a few letters, then ~M-TAB~ to see possible completions of special symbols. If you need such a symbol inside a word, terminate it with a pair of curly brackets for eg. ~\pi{}d~.
 - ~command org-entities-help~ a command to browse the complete list from a dedicated buffer
 - ~org-entities-user~ define own symbols
 - ~C-c C-x \~ (~org-toggle-pretty-entities~) Toggle display of entities as UTF-8 characters. This does not change the buffer content which remains plain ASCII, but it overlays the UTF-8 character for display purposes only.

* Latex preview
- ~org-compile-file: File "/tmp/orgtex5473MjV.dvi" wasn’t produced. Please adjust ’dvipng’ part of ‘org-preview-latex-process-alist’.~\\
  a log is generated, ~/tmp/orgtex9997XKu.log~. Something interesting is in this log: ~LaTeX Error: File `wrapfig.sty' not found.~ Then a quick search tells me texlive-latex-extra package is missing.
- ~C-c C-x C-l~ toggle latex preview
* Sort
 - ~C-c ^~ Sort the plain list. Prompt for the sorting method: numerically, alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.
